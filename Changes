0.04  Fri Aug 14 22:51:31 1998
        - preliminary pre-alpha solaris support

0.05  Wed Dec  9 18:47:39 1998
	- fixed minor compilation problems for solaris. Changed rss to
	bytes on linux for consistency with solaris; also added "time"
	and "ctime" fields to linux for consistency. Updated
	documentation in Process.pm. Folded in AIX port by David Paquet.

0.06  Wed Dec  9 23:42:05 1998
	- added HPUX port by Mike Romberg.

0.07  Wed Jan  6 14:57:04 1999
	- added FreeBSD port by Slaven Rezic. 

0.08  Thu Feb  4 00:35:53 1999 
	- Fixed bug in solaris hints file that was looking for a
	version of solaris returned by "uname -r" as > 2.5, when
	"uname -r" returns the "SunOS" version of 5.5. Fixed bug in
	linux module in which only the first field of the command line 
	was getting passed in cmndline attribute.

0.09   Fri Feb 19 23:23:53 1999 
	- Fixed bug in Linux.c, fopen() called without corresponding 
	fclose. Added empty DESTROY subs to ProcessTable.pm and Process.pm
	to fix occasional problems with mod_perl. Changed all instances of
	sv_undef in ProcessTable.xs to PL_sv_undef to comply with new 
	standard.

0.10	Sat Feb 20 11:29:35 1999
	- Added code to ProcessTable.xs to check perl patchlevel version
	and use either PL_sv_undef or sv_undef since lots of people are
	still using older versions of perl.

0.11	Sat Mar  6 19:04:39 1999
	- Fixed code that checked perl patchlevel version to check directly 
	for definition of PL_sv_undef and define it as sv_undef if it's not 
	there, since it's not clear what patchlevel we need to check for. 
	Also fixed embarrassing and unnecessary call to close() a string in 
	Solaris.c

0.12	Sun Mar 21 10:53:56 1999
	- Hopefully the final fix for the sv_undef buglet.

0.14	Fri May 14 06:30:15 1999 
	- Added patch for IRIX from W. Phillip Moore in 0.13, but forgot 
	to add files to MANIFEST and edit Changes (Duh). W. Phillip Moore's
	patch also included a minor patch for Solaris to get the page
	size from the system.
