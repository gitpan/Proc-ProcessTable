- Times (time, ctime, stime, utime, cstime, cutime) are currently done
as jiffies (1/100 sec) on linux, and as seconds on Solaris although
Solaris supports microsecond resolution (we take the seconds part out
of the Solaris time structure). Since a lot of systems seem to
support microsecond resolution (AIX also), all times should probably
be handled in microseconds. The problem of course is that this number
can get really big; presumably this is why Solaris uses a structure to
store it. I don't know what the best solution is here; pass it in as a 
long and hope that's big enough, or maybe as a string and let perl
deal with it?

- Since people are starting to provide ports and there is a real
interest in this module, there should be some sort of minimal useful
set of attributes with consistent units that all OS modules should
support. Maybe this should be part of a firmer spec than what's in the 
PORTING file.

- Ports to IRIX, SCO, Digital Unix and NT (if possible) would be nice.

- Porting the API to TCL and Python would be nice (shouldn't be hard).
