- The module doesn't currently compile in the Solaris Large File
environment; this should be easy to fix (see
README.solaris_large_file_env) but I don't have a Soalris machine to
work on.

- Since a lot of systems seem to support microsecond resolution, all
times should probably be handled in microseconds. The problem of
course is that this number can get really big; presumably this is why
Solaris uses a structure to store it. I don't know what the best
solution is here; pass it in as a long and hope that's big enough, or
maybe as a string and let perl deal with it?

-There should be some sort of minimal useful set of attributes with
consistent units that all OS modules should support. Maybe this should
be part of a firmer spec than what's in the PORTING file.

- An NT port (if possible) would be nice and quite a coup.

- Porting the API to TCL and Python would be nice (shouldn't be hard).
