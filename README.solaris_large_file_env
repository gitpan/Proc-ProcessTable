Several people have reported problems compiling the module in the
Solaris large file environment. Eventually, I hope to have the module
detect this environment during configuration and build itself
accordingly. Unfortunately I do not currently have access to a Solaris
machine, so it will be some time before I can address this (if you
come up with a patch, please mail it to me!). 

As a temporary solution, several people have reported that manually
removing the flag "-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64" from the CCFLAGS in the
Makefile will allow the module to compile correctly.
